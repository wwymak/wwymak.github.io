This year lunar new year is on the 22nd Jan, and as it nicely coincides with @sundayafternoonbakingclub penaut butter theme, I made these bite sized peanut cookies as they are popular as new year treats (or rather, more popular than usual-- I am fairly sure you can get them year round).

They are really easy to make as I took the shortcut and made them with PipandNut crunchy peanut butter -- you more or less peanut butter, oil, flour and sugar together, shape, and bake with an egg yolk egg wash. 

Admittedly I don't recall being very fond of chinese new year foods when I was growing up, so I don't have a baseline to judge these against, but I definitely find them really delicious, with a very peanutty flavour ðŸ˜Š

### Ingredients
- 180g flour
- 80g icing sugar
- 1tsp salt
- 100g crunchy peanut butter (not sweetened)
- 80g olive oil
- 2 medium egg yolks (for egg wash -- uk medium sized )

### Baking notes
- it's definitely worth sifting the flour and icing sugar to reduce lumps
- for bit sized cookies, they're around 10g each. For more substance, double the size
