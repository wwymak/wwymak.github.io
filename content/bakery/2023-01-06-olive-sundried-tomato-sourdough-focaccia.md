Olive and sun dried tomato sourdough focaccia for this weekâ€™s [@sundayafternoonbakingclub](https://www.instagram.com/sundayafternoonbakingclub/) focaccia theme. The special sauce in this is my homemade chilli oil infused with chillis, Szechuan peppercorns, star anise and a few other spices. It gave it a nice bit of heat and also loads of flavour from all the other aromatics, and I definitely prefer this to plain olive oil.

I started off with my basic sourdough focaccia recipe but used a 50-50 mix of white and whole meal bread flourâ€” and also accidentally ended up with a 100% hydration as I sifted out the bran from the wholemeal flour and forgot to compensate for it ðŸ˜†

I used a big baking tray this time as the 2nd biggest I used last time was a bit too small, but I think this tray is a big too bigâ€” the focaccia is a bit on the flat side! But still wonderfully light and puffy, so I reckoned I did a decent enough job

### Ingredients
- 240g white bread flour
- 240g wholewheat flour (bran sifted out)
- 60g semolina
- 1.25g instant yeast
- 150g refreshed starter (white)
- ~100g black olives in brine
- ~50g sundried tomatoes
- 30g[chilli oil ](https://thewoksoflife.com/how-to-make-chili-oil/) + more as needed for pans etc

### Baking notes
- getting the right size pan is key-- this time I used too large a pan and did the dough spread... It is thin enough you can call it a :pizza:
- if using non stick cookware can go a bit lighter on the oil that you add to pans 
- using non-stick oil spray is a good option (the ones you buy from a shop has lecithin added to it, which helps the oil spread, especially handy for non stick trays)
