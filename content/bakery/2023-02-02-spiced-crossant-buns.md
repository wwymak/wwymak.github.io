This is my first time making laminated bread-- the [recipe](https://kitchenprojects.substack.com/p/hot-croissant-buns) goes along the lines of: 
1. Mix ingredients (flour, yeast, butter, milk), first proof at room temp -- much like normal bread, except for the extra butter
2. Chill in fridge for a few hours to firm up the flour
3. Make butter block
4. Laminate for 2 folds (with 1 hour in the fridge in between)
5. Laminate final time with spiced butter (butter + sugar + mincepie filling)
6. Bake

I found it quite a bit trickier than laminated pastry-- the dough is a lot more elastic and hard to roll-- one is supposed to not overdo the rolling so you don't squash the butter layers together, but as the dough is so still, I am convinced I did squashed some of the butter layers... These buns also didn't expand as much as the recipe indicates it should in the final proofing step. (no way they expaned 1.5 times)

Nevertheless, they still turned out fairly tasty after baking, although I wouldn't mind a bit more flakiness ðŸ˜…

I guess an excuse to practice more laminated breads! I will make a decent croissant some day...  ðŸ˜‚
