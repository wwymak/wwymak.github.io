This is my first time making laminated bread&amp;ndash; the recipe goes along the lines of:
Mix ingredients (flour, yeast, butter, milk), first proof at room temp &amp;ndash; much like normal bread, except for the extra butter Chill in fridge for a few hours to firm up the dough Make butter block Laminate for 2 folds (with 1 hour in the fridge in between) Laminate final time with spiced butter (butter + sugar + mincepie filling) Bake I found it quite a bit trickier than laminated pastry&amp;ndash; the dough is a lot more elastic and hard to roll&amp;ndash; one is supposed to not overdo the rolling so you don&amp;rsquo;t squash the butter layers together, but as the dough is so stiff, I am convinced I did squashed some of the butter layers&amp;hellip; These buns also didn&amp;rsquo;t expand as much as the recipe indicates it should in the final proofing step.</description></item><item><title>Chinese Peanut Cookies</title><link>https://wwymak.github.io/bakery/2023-01-22-chinese-peanut-cookies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Jan 2023 19:32:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wwymak.github.io/bakery/2023-01-22-chinese-peanut-cookies/</guid><description>This year lunar new year is on the 22nd Jan, and as it nicely coincides with @sundayafternoonbakingclub penaut butter theme, I made these bite sized peanut cookies as they are popular as new year treats (or rather, more popular than usual&amp;ndash; I am fairly sure you can get them year round).
They are really easy to make as I took the shortcut and made them with PipandNut crunchy peanut butter &amp;ndash; you more or less peanut butter, oil, flour and sugar together, shape, and bake with an egg yolk egg wash.</description></item><item><title>Olive and sun dried tomato sourdough focaccia</title><link>https://wwymak.github.io/bakery/2023-01-06-olive-sundried-tomato-sourdough-focaccia/</link><pubDate>Fri, 06 Jan 2023 18:32:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wwymak.github.io/bakery/2023-01-06-olive-sundried-tomato-sourdough-focaccia/</guid><description>Olive and sun dried tomato sourdough focaccia for this weekâ€™s @sundayafternoonbakingclub focaccia theme. The special sauce in this is my homemade chilli oil infused with chillis, Szechuan peppercorns, star anise and a few other spices. It gave it a nice bit of heat and also loads of flavour from all the other aromatics, and I definitely prefer this to plain olive oil.
I started off with my basic sourdough focaccia recipe but used a 50-50 mix of white and whole meal bread flourâ€” and also accidentally ended up with a 100% hydration as I sifted out the bran from the wholemeal flour and forgot to compensate for it ðŸ˜†</description></item></channel></rss>
