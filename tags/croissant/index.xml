Mix ingredients (flour, yeast, butter, milk), first proof at room temp &amp;ndash; much like normal bread, except for the extra butter Chill in fridge for a few hours to firm up the dough Make butter block Laminate for 2 folds (with 1 hour in the fridge in between) Laminate final time with spiced butter (butter + sugar + mincepie filling) Bake I found it quite a bit trickier than laminated pastry&amp;ndash; the dough is a lot more elastic and hard to roll&amp;ndash; one is supposed to not overdo the rolling so you don&amp;rsquo;t squash the butter layers together, but as the dough is so stiff, I am convinced I did squashed some of the butter layers&amp;hellip; These buns also didn&amp;rsquo;t expand as much as the recipe indicates it should in the final proofing step.</description></item></channel></rss>
